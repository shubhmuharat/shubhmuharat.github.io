## File 001 – Project Janmabhoomi

- Category: Demographic Engineering
- Summary: An initiative presented as a housing-rights reform secretly redirected land ownership to favored political blocs through algorithmic scoring.
- Findings: Internal scorecards weighted “cultural loyalty” higher than income or tenure.
- Status: Program “under restructuring.”
- Quote from insider memo: “Every roof bought us a vote.”

## File 002 – Operation Netravarna

- Category: Mass Surveillance & Censorship
- Summary: A nationwide CCTV upgrade doubled as a behavioral-analysis network.
- Evidence: Camera firmware embedded with pattern-recognition tags linked to citizen tax IDs.
- Aftermath: When journalists traced the firmware supplier, the company dissolved within 48 hours.
- Tagline: “The eyes of the nation never blink.”

## File 003 – Operation Silent Margin

- Category: Electoral Subversion
- Summary: Unexplained EVU transfers recorded across three wards hours before polling. Recovered ballots carried identical UV micro-marks, pointing to a single campaign warehouse. Logbooks edited post-event; chain-of-custody signatures duplicated.
- Outcome: Internal audit declared “technical error.” No further review ordered.
  > “If the margin is silent, the mandate never questions us.” — [REDACTED]

## File 004 – The Student X Case

- Category: Political Prosecution
- Summary: A university activist labeled a threat after leading campus demonstrations. Critical blog removed 13 min 27 sec after upload; arrest warrant issued within an hour. Media outlets circulated identical statements before trial began.
- Outcome: Conviction fast-tracked through High Court; appeal pending.
  > “Blog status: removed. Case status: guilty. Evidence: manufactured.”

## File 005 – Project Nightshade

- Category: Organized Exploitation / Financial Laundering
- Summary: Hospitality firms used as fronts to channel illicit funds and coerce workers into prostitution. Payment ledgers disguised as “event logistics” routed through three charity trusts. Hotel manifests show identical contact numbers for separate “staff” groups.
- Outcome: Inquiry announced, then deferred indefinitely.
  > “Every ledger hides a body, every signature a silence.”
